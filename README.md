## How to run the code
Each notebook is a standalone model, with the exception of generate_data.ipynb and Data Analysis.ipynb. The former is to be run first in order to generate the datafile used to run the rest of the models, and the latter can be run to generate some preliminary analysis plots.

The remaining notebooks, PCA.ipynb, Logistic Regression.ipynb, and decision-tree.ipynb are able to be run independently assuming the datafile has been generated.
