DSCI 478 Capstone Capstone Group Project in Data Science
Final Project Preliminary Proposal

Instructor: Emily J. King
Due: March 23 at 3:00 p.m.

Group members: Logan Perkins, Kilbourne Charrier

Tentative project title: League of Legends MSI 2022 Tournament Prediction

Data set(s) to be worked with: 
Previous MSI tournament standings, division playoff standings, team and player statistics, champion pick/ban/win rates.
All obtained from https://oracleselixir.com/.

Proposed methods to be used: 
PCA to determine usefulness of predictors in predicting tournament standings across the datasets, SVD to determine if PCA is even necessary.
Supervised machine learning models to conduct prediction on standings as well as classification on specific variables. 
For example, whether a team wins given their opposing team or whether a player will take the first tower in a game.
